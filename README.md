# Project Overview
My project uses Flask, which is an Web App Development that allows me to combine Python and HTML programming languages for users to interact with on a website. Th mbta_helper essentially allows a user to input a place name or address,(preferably in Boston where the MBTA runs), and it returns the nearest MBTA stop to their inputted location. It also returns the current temperature in that city. 

# Reflection 
 Overall, this project was pretty challenging. It was the first time I had implemented Flask and integrating my python function into it. I also spent a lot of time trying to understand how to use the MAPBOX Api as well as the MBTA one. I would say most of the time was experimenting with the API's and how to extract the information I wanted. After figuring out the functions, I was able to start flask with much more ease. Throughout this project, I didn't need to ask Chatgpt much as I felt like the classroom examples were more helpful. There was one instance where I had some trouble using json, and Chatgpt was able to provide an easier way to open the url. ![Screenshot of my chat with ChatGPT.](https://github.com/lulillian/WebApp-MBTA/blob/main/json.png) 

 A challenging moment I want to reflect on was when I attempted to implement the Weather API into the project. I thought that it would have been a seamless process, but it was the most frustrating part of the assignment for me. The place_name entered such as common places in Boston like the 'Boston Commons' returned cities like Suffolk County, which was not a city, resulting in an error, as the Api doesn't work. I kept looking at the dictionaries to see what I was doing wrong. This told me that I needed to work more on dictionaries and perfect that skill, as it hinders my progress moving forward. Reflecting back, I also knew it was a code block, where I was looking at the code too much to even notice small errors, hinting that I should start on assignments sooner so that I don't feel burnt out close to the due dates.
